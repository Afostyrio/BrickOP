# BrickOP
A program to do your high school homework when learning PEMDAS.

## Θώθ What’s this?
It's my computer class final proyect for semester August - December 2021.

Profe, si usted está leyendo esto, buenas noches. Si es un ayudante, igualmente, buenas noches.

## How does it work?
It's supposed to work like this:
  * Place the `.exe` in the same folder as a `operaciones.txt` (file with the operations you would like to know the result of). The file must follow the next rules:
    - Each operation must be contained in exactly one line
    - There must be spaces between the numbers and the operators, and between the operators and parenthesis. Like this: `1 + 2 * 3 * (5 + (10 ^ 2))`.
    - At the end of the file, there must be an empty line with one space.
  * Let the `.exe` run.
  * There will be a `.txt` file with the results.

I hope someone finds this useful enough to keep updating it. It'll maybe later include some other useful stuff to solve high school boring homeworks like equation systems and such.
