A program to do your high school homework when learning PEMDAS.

## Θώθ What’s this?
It's my computer class final proyect for semester August - December 2021.

Profe, si usted está leyendo esto, buenas noches.

It's supposed to work like this:
  - Place the `.exe` in the same folder as a `.txt` file with the operations you would like to know the result of.
  - Then enter the `.exe` file and write the name of the file (including the ".txt" extension).
  - Press enter and let it run.
  - There will be a `.txt` file with the results.

I hope someone finds this useful enough to keep updating it. It maybe later include some other useful stuff to solve high school boring homeworks like equation systems and such. You know what? That sounds pretty good, let future me decide.
